Developed using python programming. The app performs OTU/ASV (Operational Taxonomic Unit/Amplicon Sequence Variant) clustering/denoising and taxonomy assignment and feature table normalization through rarefaction. 
The app is also provided with functionalities for interactive tertiary data analysis if OTU, taxonomy and metadata tables are provided. Alpha and beta diversity analysis are available as well as taxa relative abundances data.
